# Collapsing-Children

## Description

The purpose of this project was to improve, and add accessibility elements to the Horiseon Social Solution Services website, base code, and css.  I put work and effort into this project due to accessibility being an increasingly important part to web-design access by those with dissabilities or using assistive technologies to view applications.  Durring the process of refactoring the original code, I made advancements with my own personal orginzational skills.  I also learned more about commenting, correct html structuring by using semantic elements and more about CSS and HTML in general.

## Usage

The best way this project would be used is by site use with any sort of assistive technology.
A way to view how the project improves the use of the site is by opening any sort of dev tool on the web browser. *This usage example will be using Dev tools in Google Chrome.

Opening developer tools on the browser can be as easy as using shortcut - "ctrl+shift+i"
Another option would be to right click with your mouse or touchpad and scroll down to the option "inspect" or "inspect element" if you have a certain part of the site highlighted.
